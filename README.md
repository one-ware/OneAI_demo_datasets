# ONE AI Demo Datasets

## About this repository
This repository contains a collection of datasets as well as trained models that accompany our [tutorials](https://one-ware.com/docs/one-ai/potato-chip-demo) on the [OneAI Extension](https://one-ware.com/one-ai) for [OneWare Studio](https://one-ware.com/studio). We modified the datasets for the tutorials and transformed the annotations to the format that is currently used by OneWare Studio.
